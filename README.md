This is a digital recipe book, with each recipe having a title, a link to an external source, a set of ingredients, a set of tags (dessert, entree, &c.), and a description. Ingredients can be added to shopping lists one-by-one in a group from a recipe. The list of recipes is searchable by title and description.
